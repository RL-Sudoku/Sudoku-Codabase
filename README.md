# UNO-Codabase

This repository contains implementation of 2-players UNO game and several popular approximation-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms, including Deep Q-Learning and Deep SARSA.

Credit: the implementation of the UNO game is heavily based on the (RLCard)[https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard/tree/master/rlcard] package. However, most of the part relating to UNO is implemented by ourselves.
