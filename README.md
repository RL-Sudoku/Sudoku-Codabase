# UNO-Codabase

This repository contains implementation of 2-players UNO game and several popular approximation-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms, including Deep Q-Learning (DQN) and Deep SARSA.

#### Credit:

The implementation of the UNO game is heavily based on the [**RLCard**](https://github.com/datamllab/rlcard/tree/master/rlcard) package. However, most of the part relating to UNO, including training algorithms and environments is implemented by ourselves.
