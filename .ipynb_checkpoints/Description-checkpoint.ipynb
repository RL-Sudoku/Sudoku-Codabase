    "This scope of our proejct is to replicate the game of Uno in a way to allow for training with reinforcement learning type techniques. In order to make this feasible, we had to make some simplifications to the game as a way to better represent state space. For example, we decided not to include the color of the special cards (e.g. skip, reverse, etc). Despite these modifications, Uno is a very stochastic game, and thus this yields a state space that is on the scale of $10^{72}$. "
